Ensure your services are ready to perform with Wait4it—a lightweight tool designed to test service readiness and exit gracefully once the checks are successful.

## What is Wait4it?

Wait4it is a simple, powerful command-line tool that:

- **Waits for Services to Be Ready**: Checks ports, databases, or HTTP endpoints to confirm they’re operational.
- **Exits Upon Success**: Once the target service is ready, Wait4it terminates with an exit code of 0, making it ideal for scripts, pipelines, and startup sequences.
- **Lightweight and Focused**: It’s not an orchestrator; it’s a utility designed to integrate seamlessly into your existing workflows.

## Key Features

- **Port Readiness**: Verify if TCP ports are open and accepting connections.
- **Service Health Checks**: Ensure MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, RabbitMQ, Memcached, ElasticSearch, and Aerospike are fully operational.
- **HTTP Monitoring**: Validate HTTP response codes and content.
- **Custom Timeouts**: Configure wait times for services before marking them as unavailable.

## A Practical Example:

Let’s say your application depends on MySQL and needs to perform critical database operations during startup. In a complex Kubernetes environment, MySQL’s port might open quickly, but the database itself could take extra time to initialize.

Without a readiness tool, your application might attempt to connect prematurely, leading to startup failures.

**Enter Wait4it**:

1. Configure Wait4it to check MySQL’s availability continuously.
2. It waits until MySQL is fully ready (not just the port being open).
3. Upon success, Wait4it exits with code 0, allowing your application to proceed with confidence.

This approach ensures smooth service synchronization while leaving orchestration to your existing tools, like Kubernetes or CI/CD pipelines.

## Get Started with Wait4it

Say goodbye to failed startups and hello to readiness. Whether in development or production, Wait4it is your go-to solution for ensuring service health with minimal effort.
